resume_header_intro: "<p>I think in systems, but work through people, building software the way a good strategist plays chess: with clarity, foresight, and a genuine care for the players on the board. As a Technical Lead, I merge creativity with engineering discipline to deliver cross-platform applications and software systems that are not just technically robust, but also human-centered.</p>

<p>My journey has taken me from crafting C++ code in game studios to guiding teams through projects across industries, from everyday consumer apps to complex enterprise ecosystems. I help turn ideas into working products, making sure theyâ€™re secure, scalable, and purposeful.</p>

<p>With deep experience in Modern Android Development (MAD), Kotlin Multiplatform, and Flutter, I bring curiosity, adaptability, and a hands-on spirit to every project. I enjoy working side by side with teams, solving problems, sharing ideas, and building software that matters.</p>"
